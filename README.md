# INET4031 - Lab 4 Website

This repo contains my modified Module 4 HTML and JavaScript web webpage.  
You can now see an example of how JavaScript can alter an image's attributes (the lightbulb turning on and off) and add aspects of interactivity to a simple webpage. 

### Modifications
- Changed the background color to pink  
- Added my name (Mohammed Mohamed) in the body of the webpage   
- Rephrased the text to explain what you would see on the page  
- Formatted the the HTML as nicely as possible for human readability  

### What's the point
For me, this lab demonstrates how HTML is used to give structure to a web page and layout for content. JavaScript operates by adding interactivity to a web page and responding to user action.  
It demonstrated to me how small JavaScript can make dynamically updating content in real-time.
